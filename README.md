## Creating a new theme

There are currently two formats for themes. Read about the [theme format specification](FORMAT.md) to know more about all the themeable elements and their properties.

For the older format (AGS 3.4.1 alpha and above) you can use [Rulaman's AGS-ThemeEditor](https://github.com/Rulaman/AGS-ThemeEditor)

For the new format (AGS 3.6.0.36 and above) you can use a more concise color notation with HTML colors, and thus any text editor should do, even online ones like jsoneditoronline that can provide a more convenient way to display/colorpick values.

You can start from an existing theme
